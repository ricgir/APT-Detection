# Threat Detection Rule Development Workflow

This project implements a structured, six-stage workflow for the end-to-end creation, testing, and validation of security detection rules across multiple operating systems.

## **1. Environment Setup & Integration**

This foundational stage involves preparing the complete analysis pipeline for both Windows and Ubuntu endpoints.

- **Deploy Infrastructure**: Set up the central ELK Stack and the target virtual machines (Windows 11 and Ubuntu).

- **Install Agents**: Deploy agents on the target systems to collect security logs (e.g., Winlogbeat for Windows, Elastic Agent for Ubuntu).

- **Configure Data Pipeline**: Ensure logs from both operating systems are successfully ingested and parsed by Logstash and Elasticsearch.

## **2. Threat Simulation & Log Generation**

This stage creates the necessary data by emulating adversary behavior on the appropriate target OS.

- **Execute Tests**: Run controlled attack simulations on the target systems, using Atomic Red Team for Windows and custom rules or scripts for Ubuntu.

- **Generate Logs**: Trigger the creation of detailed telemetry and security events on the target systems.

## **3. Log Analysis & Pattern Identification**

This stage focuses on finding the "signal in the noise" within the logs collected from all endpoints.

- **Isolate Events**: Use Kibana to query and filter logs, pinpointing the exact events generated by the simulation on either the Windows or Ubuntu host.

- **Identify Indicators**: Analyze key log fields (e.g., process command lines, file paths, user accounts) to find unique patterns that characterize the malicious activity.

## **4. KQL Rule Development**

This stage translates the analytical findings into a functional detection query.

- **Translate Logic to KQL**: Convert the identified patterns into a precise Kibana Query Language (KQL) query.

- **Define Rule Logic**: The KQL query forms the core logic that will be used to trigger a security alert, regardless of the source operating system.

## **5. Rule Validation & Finalization**

This final, iterative stage ensures the rule is accurate, reliable, and ready for a multi-OS operational environment.

- **Iterative Tuning**: Test the draft rule against historical log data from both Windows and Ubuntu. Refine the KQL query to minimize false positives (benign alerts) and eliminate false negatives (missed detections).

- **Assign Risk Score**: Once the rule is stable, apply a numerical score to classify its severity and aid in alert prioritization.

- **Live Validation**: Re-run the original simulation on the appropriate target—the Atomic Red Team test on Windows or the custom rule on Ubuntu—to confirm the finalized rule generates a real-time, accurate alert in the Kibana Security App.
