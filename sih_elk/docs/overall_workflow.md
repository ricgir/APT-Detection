# Threat Detection Rule Development Workflow

This project implements a structured, six-stage workflow for the end-to-end creation, testing, and validation of security detection rules.


## **1. Environment Setup & Integration**

This foundational stage involves preparing the complete analysis pipeline.

- **Deploy Infrastructure**: 
Set up the ELK Stack and target Windows 11 VMs.


- **Install Agents**: 
Deploy Winlogbeat on the target machine to collect security logs.


- **Configure Data Pipeline**: 
Ensure logs are successfully ingested and parsed by Logstash and Elasticsearch.

## **2. Threat Simulation & Log Generation** 

This stage creates the necessary data by emulating adversary behavior.

- **Execute Tests**: 
Run controlled attack simulations using the Atomic Red Team framework.


- **Generate Logs**: 
Trigger the creation of detailed telemetry and security events on the target system.

## **3. Log Analysis & Pattern Identification** 

This stage focuses on finding the "signal in the noise" within the collected logs.

- **Isolate Events**: 
Use Kibana to query and filter logs, pinpointing the exact events generated by the simulation.


- **Identify Indicators**: 
Analyze key log fields to find unique patterns that characterize the malicious activity.

## **4. KQL Rule Development** 

This stage translates the analytical findings into a functional detection query.


- **Translate Logic to KQL**: 
Convert the identified patterns into a precise Kibana Query Language (KQL) query. 


- **Define Rule Logic**: 
The KQL query forms the core logic that will be used to trigger a security alert.

## **5. Rule Validation & Finalization** 

This final, iterative stage ensures the rule is accurate, reliable, and ready for an operational environment.

- **Iterative Tuning**: 
Test the draft rule against historical log data. Refine the KQL query to minimize false positives (benign alerts) and eliminate false negatives (missed detections).


- **Assign Risk Score**: 
Once the rule is stable, apply a numerical score to classify its severity and aid in alert prioritization.


- **Live Validation**: 
Re-run the corresponding Atomic Red Team test to confirm the finalized rule generates a real-time, accurate alert in the Kibana Security App.
